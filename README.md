Used numerical procedure to extract dynamical features from a video using the dynamic mode decomposition algorithm

Dynamic Mode Decomposition is an equation-free technique which does not require to know the underlying governing equations of the complex data. 
As a result of massive datasets from various resources, like experiments, simulation, historical records, etc. has led to an increasing demand for an efficient method for data mining and analysis techniques. The main goals of data mining are the description and prediction. Description involves finding patterns in the data and prediction involves predicting the system dynamics. An important aspect when analyzing an algorithm is testing. 
In this work, DMD a data-based technique is used to test different cases to find the underlying patterns, predict the system dynamics and for reconstruction oforiginal data. 
The algorithm working has been implemented in MATLAB in this project. Along with that, an application is implemented. Finally, this project makes an attempt to understand the DMDâ€™s performance and its various applications so that it can be applied in a variety of fields in future.
